\title{Method to perform clustering on the samples of an ExposomeSet}
\usage{
clustering(object, method, cmethod, ..., warnings = TRUE)
}
\arguments{
\item{object}{\code{ExposomeSet} containing the exposures used for the
clustering process}

\item{method}{Function applied to the exposures of \code{object}. This
function must has an argument named as \code{data} that will receive the
matrix of exposures.}

\item{cmethod}{(optional) Function to obtain the classification from the object
generated with \code{method}.}

\item{...}{Passed to content of \code{method}.}

\item{warnings}{(default \code{TRUE}) If set to \code{FALSE} warnings will
not be displayed.}
}
\value{
\code{ExposomeClust} with the original exposures and the
classification of each exposure.
}
\description{
This method allows to create an \link{ExposomeClust} object from an
\link{ExposomeSet} object by clustering samples through the exposure
levels. The method is flexible to accept any clustering method
(\code{method}) that allows to obtain a classification (\code{cmethod})
of the samples. The function assigned to argument \code{method} must have
an argument called \code{data}, waiting for the matrix of exposures
(samples as rows, exposures as columns). If the result object of the
\code{method} has no accessor \code{$classification}, then a \code{cmethod}
is required and will be applied on the result of \code{method} to obtain
a labelled vector with the samples' classification.
}
\note{
The function assigned to \code{cmethod} will be directy applied to
the result of the \code{method} as: \code{cmethod(model)}; being
\code{model} the result of \code{method}.

\examples{
\dontrun{
# Being x an ExposomeSet
# EXAMPLE 1: Clustering with mclust
library(mclust)
c <- clustering(exp method = Mclust, G = 2)
classification(c)  # This works since the result of Mclust has an accessor
                   # $classification
}

# EXAMPLE 2: Cluseting with flexmix
data("exposome")
library(flexmix)
# First we carete a function to apply flexmix to the ExposomeSet
flexmix_clust <- function(data, ...) {
  flexmix(formula = data~1, ...)
}

# Then we apply the method to the ExposomeSet
c <- clustering(exp, method = flexmix_clust, k = 2, model = FLXMCmvnorm())
# To try to obtain the classification for the result will fail since the
# result of flexmix has not an accessor called $classiciation
# classification(c)

# We create a function to get the classification
flexmix_clas <- function(model, ...) {
  return(clusters(model))
}

# We put it to the ExposomeClust

c <- clustering(exp, method = flexmix_clust, cmethod = flexmix_clas,
    k = 2, model = FLXMCmvnorm())
classification(c) # This works because the ExposomeClust has a way to get
                  # the classification
